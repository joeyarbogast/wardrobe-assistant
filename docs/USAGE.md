## Best Practices

### Image Management

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Use clear, well-lit photos
- Screenshot product pages (shows item flat/clean)
- Name files descriptively: `Brand_Color_Type.png`
- Organize by category (tops/, bottoms/, etc.)
- Keep image sizes reasonable (< 5MB)

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Use blurry or dark photos
- Mix multiple items in one image
- Use generic filenames (IMG_001.jpg)
- Store in random directories

### Metadata Quality

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Review AI-generated metadata carefully
- Add personal notes ("runs small", "very warm")
- Use consistent tag vocabulary
- Update formality based on your perception
- Keep seasons realistic for your climate

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Accept AI suggestions blindly
- Skip the review step
- Use random/inconsistent tags
- Ignore obvious errors

### Recommendation Workflow

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Be specific about context (occasion, weather, duration)
- Mention special considerations upfront
- Review all options before deciding
- Generate HTML for important events (save for reference)
- Modify recommendations to your preference

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Give vague context ("going out")
- Ignore weather/formality requirements
- Always take first recommendation
- Feel locked into suggestions

### Feedback Loop

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Rate outfits within a few days (while fresh)
- Be honest about what didn't work
- Note modifications you made
- Provide specific details in notes
- Take photos when possible

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Rate everything 5 stars (StyleBot can't learn)
- Wait weeks to provide feedback (you'll forget)
- Skip feedback for "unremarkable" outfits (data is valuable)
- Only rate positive experiences

### Git & Version Control

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Commit after bulk changes (imports, updates)
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Review changes before committing
- Keep backup of data files

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Commit after every single item add
- Use vague messages ("update")
- Ignore git entirely (lose change history)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How many items should I start with?**
A: Start with 10-20 frequently worn items. Build from there. No need to add every sock and t-shirt immediately.

**Q: Should I add seasonal items I'm not currently wearing?**
A: Yes! Add them when you have time, even if out of season. Then they're ready when weather changes.

**Q: Can I edit the JSON files directly?**
A: Yes, but use `*update-item` when possible. Direct editing risks breaking the index/items sync.

**Q: What if StyleBot recommends something I don't like?**
A: Perfect! Try `*what-if` to explore alternatives, or modify the recommendation and rate it with your changes. StyleBot learns from this.

**Q: How often should I provide feedback?**
A: Rate at least weekly outfits. The more feedback, the better StyleBot learns your preferences.

**Q: Can I use this for formal events (weddings, black tie)?**
A: Yes! Add your formal wear to the wardrobe. StyleBot handles formality levels 1-10.

**Q: What about accessories (watches, jewelry, bags)?**
A: Add them as wardrobe items! Use type: "accessories" and appropriate formality levels.
