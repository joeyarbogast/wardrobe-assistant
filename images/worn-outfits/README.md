# Worn Outfit Photos

This directory stores full-body photos of outfits you've actually worn based on StyleBot recommendations.

## Purpose

These photos help StyleBot:
- **Learn what actually looks good on you** (fit, proportions, color harmony with your skin tone)
- **Understand fit issues** (items that run large/small, length issues, etc.)
- **Refine future recommendations** based on real-world results
- **Build a visual history** of successful outfits

## Directory Structure

Organize photos by recommendation ID:

```
worn-outfits/
â”œâ”€â”€ rec_20251005_001/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ front.jpg          # Required - front view
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ side.jpg           # Optional - side profile
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ back.jpg           # Optional - back view
â”œâ”€â”€ rec_20251005_002/
â””â”€â”€ rec_20251005_003/
```

## Photo Guidelines

### **Camera Setup**
- Full-body shot (head to feet)
- Well-lit area (natural light is best)
- Neutral background (helps StyleBot focus on the outfit)
- Phone camera is perfectly fine!

### **Poses**
- **Front:** Stand naturally, arms at sides or slightly bent
- **Side (optional):** Shows fit and proportions from profile
- **Back (optional):** Useful for jackets, overall fit

### **Timing**
Take photos either:
- Right before wearing (to capture the outfit fresh)
- After wearing (to see how it held up during the day)
- Both! (before/after comparison)

### **File Naming**
- `front.jpg` or `front.png` - Main front view
- `side.jpg` - Side profile
- `back.jpg` - Back view
- `front_before.jpg` / `front_after.jpg` - Before/after variations

## Workflow

### **1. Get Recommendation**
```
*recommend-outfit
```
You'll receive recommendation like `rec_20251005_001`

### **2. Wear the Outfit**
Wear it for the intended occasion

### **3. Take Photos**
- Create folder: `images/worn-outfits/rec_20251005_001/`
- Take full-body photos and save them there

### **4. Provide Feedback**
```
*rate-outfit
```

StyleBot will:
- Ask for the recommendation ID
- Ask about your experience
- **Ask if you have photos**
- If yes, analyze them using AI vision
- Learn from what actually works on you!

### **5. StyleBot Analyzes Photos**

When you provide photos, StyleBot will examine:
- âœ… **Fit:** Does each item fit well? Any length/sizing issues?
- âœ… **Proportions:** Do the pieces work together visually?
- âœ… **Colors:** How do the colors look with your skin tone and in real lighting?
- âœ… **Style:** Does it achieve the intended look?
- âœ… **Details:** Tucked/untucked, sleeve roll, accessories placement

This analysis is saved in the feedback JSON and informs future recommendations!

## Privacy

These photos are stored **locally on your machine only**. They're never uploaded anywhere. The AI vision analysis happens locally through Claude Code.

        "analysis": {
          "fit": "Light blue shirt fits well - sleeves hit at right length. Chinos could be hemmed 1 inch.",

          "proportions": "Proportions are balanced. Shirt-to-pants ratio looks professional.",

        }

  }
}
```

## Tips

- **Don't stress about perfect photos** - casual phone photos work great
- **Consistency helps** - same location/lighting makes comparisons easier
- **You don't need photos for every outfit** - but they really help StyleBot learn!
- **Before/after is valuable** - shows how outfit holds up during wear

---

When in doubt, just take a quick full-body selfie in good lighting. That's all StyleBot needs! ðŸ“¸
